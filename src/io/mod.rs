/// Trait for writing a `Building` to a stream.

/// This trait extends `Write` with a version-aware method for serializing
/// `Building` instances. The version is written first and then the building
/// data is serialized according to that version.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use sw_structure_io::structs::*;
/// use sw_structure_io::io::WriteBuilding;
/// use std::io::Cursor;
///
/// let building = Building::default();
/// let mut buffer = Cursor::new(Vec::new());
///
/// buffer.write_building(&building, 0).unwrap();
/// ```
/// 
/// # Errors
/// - Returns an error if the version is unsupported.
/// - Returns an error if writing fails at any point.
/// 
/// # Partial Writes
/// Even if an error occurs during serialization (e.g., vector sizes exceed allowed limits),
/// some bytes may already have been written to the stream. Users should be aware that
/// failed calls can leave the output in a partially written state.
